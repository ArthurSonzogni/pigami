# Description
Roll a rectangular cube and reach the finish without falling!
Buttons, Traps and other objects are making level more and more challenging.
After the first 12 levels, the next ones are algorithmically generated.

This game use the [SMK library](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/smk) made by
the same author of this game.

Disclaimer:
~~~
This game was originaly made 9 years ago in 2011. It was my first 3D game. Then
in 2019, I converted it into WebAssembly. Even if it has been refactored a bit,
the code is still low quality.
